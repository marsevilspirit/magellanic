Hi, my name is marsevilspirit. Iâ€™m a software programmer. I was born in the northeastern part of China. I am currently studying for a degree in Internet of Things Engineering at Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications.

I like open source and programming. The language I mainly use now is Go, but I have also written in C/C++, Rust, Clojure, Python, Lua in the past. I mainly use neovim as my editor, and neovim is a prerequisite for my love of programming.

On May 9, 2025, at 2 AM, I had the honor of participating in Google Summer of Code. I am contributing to this event still.

Although Chinese is my mother tongue, I have decided to use only English in my blog. This way, I can practice my English and make my articles understandable to people all over the world.
